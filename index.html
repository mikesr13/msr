            <p>I had a great time learning Java and a bit of exposure to Android Studio during my college days, we tackled Java in our OOP subject while we used Android Studio as our platform during our Capstone Project entitled "Crop Bank" and for that we received Best Researchers Award.
            Also I had an opportunity to participate in another pratical training last 2021 for Programming (JAVA) NC III.</p>
